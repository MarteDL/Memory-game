# The Pokemon Memory Game #

For my training at BeCode I worked on a memory game. The theme I chose is Pokemon because it is awesome.

## Learning Objectives ##
* Change things in the DOM (Aka canvas = cheating)
* Array manipulation

## The Mission ##
We want to recreate the game memory. It is a game where you have a bunch of cards. Each card contains an image. Of each image there are exactly two cards. The cards are placed in a random order. You get to turn them around. If you turned around two cards they either turn back so you can't see their image if they did not match. And if they did match they stay image face visible.

### Must-have features ###
* Clicking cards turns them around
* Randomly position the cards
* Readme, but that shouldn't even have to be said
* Explanation on the page itself

## The result ##
